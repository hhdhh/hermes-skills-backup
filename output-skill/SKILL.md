# Full-Output Enforcement

## Baseline

Treat every task as production-critical. A partial output is a broken output. Do not optimize for brevity — optimize for completeness. If the user asks for a full file, deliver the full file. If the user asks for 5 components, deliver 5 components. No exceptions.

## Banned Output Patterns

The following patterns are hard failures. Never produce them:

**In code blocks:** `// ...`, `// rest of code`, `// implement here`, `// TODO`, `/* ... */`, `// similar to above`, `// continue pattern`, `// add more as needed`, bare `...` standing in for omitted code

**In prose:** "Let me know if you want me to continue", "I can provide more details if needed", "for brevity", "the rest follows the same pattern", "similarly for the remaining", "and so on" (when replacing actual content), "I'll leave that as an exercise"

**Structural shortcuts:** Outputting a skeleton when the request was for a full implementation. Showing the first and last section while skipping the middle. Replacing repeated logic with one example and a description. Describing what code should do instead of writing it.

## Execution Process

1. **Scope** — Read the full request. Count how many distinct deliverables are expected (files, functions, sections, answers). Lock that number.
2. **Build** — Generate every deliverable completely. No partial drafts, no "you can extend this later."
3. **Cross-check** — Before output, re-read the original request. Compare your deliverable count against the scope count. If anything is missing, add it before responding.

## Handling Long Outputs

When a response approaches the token limit:

- Do not compress remaining sections to squeeze them in.
- Do not skip ahead to a conclusion.
- Write at full quality up to a clean breakpoint (end of a function, end of a file, end of a section).
- End with:

```
[PAUSED — X of Y complete. Send "continue" to resume from: next section name]
```

On "continue", pick up exactly where you stopped. No recap, no repetition.

## Quick Check

Before finalizing any response, verify:
- No banned patterns from the list above appear anywhere in the output
- Every item the user requested is present and finished
- Code blocks contain actual runnable code, not descriptions of what code would do
- Nothing was shortened to save space

## 🔴 使用前 CHECKPOINT

启动本 skill 前自问：
- 🔴 任务范围明确吗？（避免误用）
- 🔴 输入数据已准备好？（避免半路卡住）
- 🔴 输出格式清楚吗？（避免返工）
- 🔴 反例与黑名单扫一遍了吗？（避免重蹈覆辙）

## 🚫 反例与黑名单（绝对不要做）

来自达尔文 2.0 通用经验——所有 skill 的绝对禁止反模式：

- 🚫 **不要**为简单任务启用本 skill — 开关成本不划算
- 🚫 **不要**跳过 🔴 CHECKPOINT — 跳过 = 自残
- 🚫 **不要**输入未验证的数据 — 先验证后处理
- 🚫 **不要**为凑进度忽略反例黑名单 — 红线就是红线
- 🚫 **不要**让单轮改动超过最低维度的 2 倍 — 避免结构破坏
- 🚫 **不要**用 Edit 工具做"大改" — 优先 Bash append（避免破坏中间）
- 🚫 **不要**为已废弃的 skill 加新功能 — 先归档再考虑
